## Part 1: Data


Let's berifly review some concepts we have lernt so far from the course. You may remember from 

[lecture video on week 1 Section: Observational Studies & Experiments](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/lecture/Qw8iF/observational-studies-experiments), that  observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection. Researchers perform an observational study when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via
surveys, review medical or company records,

When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct an experiment.

To check if there really is a causal connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are assigned a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a randomized experiment.


### BUt our data
The BRFSS objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population. Factors assessed by the BRFSS in 2013 include tobacco use, HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention, exercise, immunization, health status, healthy days â€” health-related quality of life, health care access, inadequate sleep, hypertension awareness, cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions, alcohol consumption, fruits and vegetables consumption, arthritis burden, and seatbelt use. Since 2011, BRFSS conducts both landline telephone- and cellular telephone-based surveys. In conducting the BRFSS landline telephone survey, interviewers collect data from a randomly selected adult in a household. In conducting the cellular telephone version of the BRFSS questionnaire, interviewers collect data from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing.


### my anwer

This is an observational study. Since the study does not make use of random assignment. 

However, because we have choosen samples randomly through selected adult, therefor e resulted sample may represent a population. Therefore study result is generaizable to the pupulation at large. But, random assignment only occures only in experimental settings, Through random assignment we ensure that different characteristics are represented equally in treatment and control groups. Finally, random assignment allows us to make causal conclusions based on the study. 

remember from course video in week 1 that most of the observational studies have random sampling but not random assignments and therefore are not casual , but generaizable.
